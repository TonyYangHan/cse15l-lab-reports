# CSE 15L Lab Report 4 Week 7

Author: Yang Han
PID: A16916031

Vim is a really useful tool when comes to editing files on a remote server. On a remote server, it is likely that there is no available and handy text editor such as VS Code. Vim offered people ability to edit files on the remote server directly without using scp to update files(which is a lot of typing).

## Part 1
In this report, I will use vim to change all occurence of ==`start`== in DocSearchServer.java on the remote server. The sequence of keys that I pressed are shown below.

Overall Sequence:
==`/start<Enter>cebase<Esc>n.n.`==

* When I just entered DocSearchServer.java using vim:

![Start](https://TonyYangHan.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/start.jpg)

* Pressed ==`/start`==

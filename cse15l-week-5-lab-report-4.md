The `find` command in linux is a really useful command for us to find some files or directories. For this command, many options are available so that we can use the different options to achieve different purposes. In this report, `-size`, `-mmin`, `-ls` (and combinations with other options)will be explored in finding files.

* `-size` option
1. The command line entry below returns all the files under `technical/` directory that have sizes greater than 200kB.
```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:246$ find technical/ -size +200k
technical/911report/chapter-13.4.txt
technical/911report/chapter-13.5.txt
technical/911report/chapter-3.txt
technical/government/About_LSC/commission_report.txt
technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen/bill.txt
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/GovernmentAuditingStandards_yb2002ed.txt
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/Statements_Feb28-1997_volume.txt
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office/d01591sp.txt
```

2. The command line entry below returns all files that have sizes below 2kB
```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:252$ find technical/ -size -2k
technical/plos/pmed.0020191.txt
technical/plos/pmed.0020226.txt
```

3. The command line entry below shows how `-size` can combine with `-exec` to remove all files under `technical/` directory that have sizes below 2kB. This is being checked later by finding all files under `technical/` that have sizes below 2kB. The empty result indicated a successful removal.
```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:254$ find technical/ -size -2k -exec rm {} \;
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:255$ find technical/ -size -2k
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:256$
```

`-size` options is useful because I can find files with various sizes without looking at their contents or wordcount. This is especially useful when we see the files generated by some program. Some of the file may be too small or even empty. Thus, we can remove those file by executing some commands afterwards(the third block in this section).

* `-mmin` option
1. The command line entry below returns the file under `technical/` directory that I modified in the past 10 minutes.

```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:315$ find technical/911report -mmin -10
technical/911report/chapter-8.txt
```

2. The command line entry below returns the file and sub-directory under `technical/` directory that I modified in the past 120 minutes.

```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:324$ find technical/ -mmin -120
technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
technical/911report/chapter-5.txt
technical/911report/chapter-8.txt
technical/plos
```

3. The command line entry below returns the sub-directory under `technical/` directory that I modified in the past 120 minutes. (`-type` restricts the type of output to directories only)
```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:326$ find technical/ -type d -mmin -120
technical/plos
```

This options is useful because it allow me view the files I recently modified at specified time. For example, if I finished work and uploaded the files to the remote account at my office, I will be able to retrieve them immediately after I go home. This is especially useful if I add type so that I can look at files or directories only.

* `-ls` option
1. This command line entry below returns a list of information of all files with a pattern of `chapter*.txt` in `technical/911report/` directory that have sizes smaller than 50kB.
```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:319$ find technical/911report/chapter*.txt -size -50k -ls
50002714   52 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22    47307 Oct 26 09:35 technical/911report/chapter-10.txt
```

2. This command line entry below returns a list of information of all files with a pattern of `*.txt` (all `.txt` files) in `technical/911report/` directory that have sizes smaller than 50kB.
```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:320$ find technical/biomed/*.txt -size -10k -ls
50003598    8 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     6297 Oct 26 09:35 technical/biomed/1471-2334-3-13.txt
50135042    8 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     6804 Oct 26 09:35 technical/biomed/1471-2490-3-2.txt
```
3. This command line entry returns a listing of information of all `.txt` files with a path of pattern `technical/*/*.txt` that have sizes smaller than 3kB.
```
[cs15lfa22qj@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1:321$ find technical/*/*.txt -size -3k -ls
50138075    4 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     2016 Oct 26 09:35 technical/plos/pmed.0020028.txt
50138084    4 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     1342 Oct 26 09:35 technical/plos/pmed.0020048.txt
50138098    4 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     1538 Oct 26 09:35 technical/plos/pmed.0020082.txt
50138178    4 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     1444 Oct 26 09:35 technical/plos/pmed.0020120.txt
50138191    4 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     1408 Oct 26 09:35 technical/plos/pmed.0020157.txt
50138206    4 -rwxr-x---   1 cs15lfa22qj ieng6_cs15lfa22     1042 Oct 26 09:35 technical/plos/pmed.0020192.txt
```

This options is useful because it lists the information of the resulting files so that I can see the last modified time and characters in them without taking extra steps looking for information for each file. 

## The END! Thank you!
